# Step 1: Setting up Nginx

1. SSH into your Hostinger VPS (if not already connected)

2. Create Nginx configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/sharebazz.in
```

3. Copy and paste this exact configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name sharebazz.in;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

4. Save the file:
- Press CTRL + X
- Press Y to confirm
- Press Enter to save

5. Verify the configuration:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```
You should see: "nginx: configuration test is successful"
